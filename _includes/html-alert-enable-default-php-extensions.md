If you need to enable default PHP extensions that are not highlighted below, you must upload them to your Windows Azure Web Site then enable as instructed in <a href="#enable-php-extensions">Enable PHP Extensions</a>. Loading default extensions in this way is required as extensions cannot be dynamically loaded in the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.per-user.php" class="alert-link">.user.ini</a> file.
